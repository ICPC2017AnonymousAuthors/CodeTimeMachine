# Code Time Machine
The *Code Time Machine* is a lightweight IntelliJ IDE plugin which uses visualization techniques to depict the history of any chosen file augmented with information mined from the underlying versioning system. Inspired by Appleâ€™s Time Machine, this tool allows both developers and the system itself to seamlessly move through time.
